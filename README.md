# This is my guide to get Perfume Genie 2.0 to work in ESPhome.

My Perfume Genie is know connected through ESPhome,
and i control fan speed.<br>
The LED light up blue when connected,red if disconnects.<br>
Green when fan is running.<br>
The rear button toggels the fan.<br>

I've set up timers in Nodered for run time,that can easily be done with HA automations to.<br>


Will try to get a gudie for what i did here soon.<br>
